Safe Solo AWP:
 Gets alliance wall stake at start
 does ring side auton to clamp mogo and score the two stack on our side, then goes to the middle to score more rings and finally goes to touch the ladder base
 base version should get 1 ring in AWS and hopefully 3 rings on mogo

Optimized mogo rush (same as vid avi sent)
 starts angled (will need to figure out alignment) to immediately rush to the mogo, hitting the two stack on the way
 Need: better clamping to get the mogo at the weird angle
 takes middle mogo back on our side
 scores the red ring that fell somewhere
 base version gets 2 rings on two mogos

Optimized ring rush (same vid avi sent)
 same start as current
 Intakes the middle rings by moving along the autonomous line, therefore needs no dead zones in intake (and possibly wider intake) to be able to do that
 In Elim version moves to corner to possibly immediately score it
 base version gets 4 rings, which is why modifications are extra important here

(Optional?) 4. Safe Mogo-side auton
    basically what we ran at firebirds, two rings on mogo + any modifications we add (see below)

Modifications that can be added to the routes:
    Color Sort: makes the middle portions safer since we won't score red rings like 197B did in elims, also provides a makeshift jank way to get the top ring on a two stack
    Intake Lift: allows us to properly get the two stack top ring
    Corner intake modification: some mech or small thing that allows us to intake top or 3rd highest ring in the corner
